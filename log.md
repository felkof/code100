## Examples

### Day 0: October 15, 2019 (Example 1)

#### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

###Day 1: October 27, 2019 (Functions)
####(Function Definition, Lambdas and Generators)
**Today's Progress:** I worked on functions. I learnt about how they are defined and the various use cases 
of Lambda. I also learnt about how variables were handled in functions(Variable Scope).
And also about generators. I struggled to understand certain concepts in Variable Scope
but I believe this will improve as I practice and make more mistakes.
